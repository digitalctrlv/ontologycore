  <p>
    To represent the ontology visually and to provide an intuitive understanding of the structure, we visualized the OWL model exported from Protégé as RDF triples and explored several graph representations. Because the entire ontology contains a large amount of information, a single static diagram is often too dense to read. We therefore produced multiple visualizations using different tools and perspectives to highlight specific parts of the model.
  </p>

  <div class="kg-figure">
    <img src="img/aes_classses.png" alt="OntoGraph focused on Aesthetic" />
    <p class="kg-caption">Figure 1 : OntoGraph view focused on the core entity <em>Aesthetic</em>. The view shows classes directly connected to Aesthetic and related subclasses (Community, Context, Emotion, AestheticElement, etc.), giving a quick overview of the main building blocks that form an aesthetic.</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    OntoGraph could give a useful overview, but it cannot display the names of object properties directly on each link. To show concrete property names and relationships, we exported OntoGraph to a directed-graph (.dot) format. The result shows labeled arrows that indicate which object properties connect the main classes to <em>Aesthetic</em>.
  </p>

  <div class="kg-figure">
    <img src="img/aes_digraph.png" alt="Graph with object property labels" />
    <p class="kg-caption">Figure 2 : Core classes rendered with object-property labels on the edges. This view clarifies, for example, how <em>Context</em> and <em>ConceptualIdea</em> shape an aesthetic, and how <em>AestheticElement</em> and <em>LifeStyle</em> concretely embody it.</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Next is a focus on the creative process perspective. We modelled aesthetic diffusion as a three-stage creative process; <em>Divergence</em>, <em>Convergence</em>, and <em>Metaconvergence</em>, and used graph links (e.g., <code>resultsIn</code>) to show how these stages produce or stabilize an aesthetic. The cycle representation also suggests how one aesthetic can give rise to or influence another.
  </p>

  <div class="kg-figure-vertical">
    <img src="img/aes_creativeprocess_digraph.png" alt="Creative process cycle: Divergence, Convergence, Metaconvergence" />
    <p class="kg-caption">Figure 3 : Visualization of the creative-process cycle. Nodes represent process classes and edges show relations that link stages to aesthetic outcomes and to other aesthetics.</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    We then loaded our dataset of instantiated aesthetics and attempted instance level visualizations. The example below shows elements related to <em>Dark Academia</em>. Although this instance graph is somewhat dense, it helps reveal which aesthetic elements, emotions, and behaviours concretely characterize <em>Dark Academia</em>.
  </p>

  <div class="kg-figure">
    <img src="img/DarkAcademia_relations.png" alt="Dark Academia instance-level graph" />
    <p class="kg-caption">Figure 4 : Instance level graph for <em>Dark Academia</em>. Instance nodes (purple diamonds) connect to category nodes (ochre dots), showing concrete examples of elements, emotions, and behaviours associated with the aesthetic.</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The image below demonstrates the creative process phases (Divergence, Convergence, Metaconvergence) at the instance level. We can understand that <em>Dark Academia</em> maps to specific phase activities  e.g., <em>Inspiration, Bricolage, Ideation</em> in Divergence; <em>Synthesis, Selection</em> in Convergence; and <em>Recontextualization, Reproduction</em> in Metaconvergence.
  </p>

  <div class="kg-figure">
    <img src="img/DarkAcademia_process.png" alt="Dark Academia process-phase mapping" />
    <p class="kg-caption">Figure 5 : Process-phase mapping for <em>Dark Academia</em>. Instances are grouped by Divergence / Convergence / Metaconvergence, showing how concrete activities and elements realise each phase.</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Finally, we provide an interactive visualization of the full ontology to explore concepts, classes, properties dynamically.
