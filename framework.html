    <h2>2. Theoretical Framework</h2>
    <p>To clarify the relationship between aesthetics and creativity, our project draws upon the 4P's Model of Creativity proposed by Mel Rhodes (1961), which defines creativity through four interrelated components: Person, Process, Product, and Press.</p>
    <p>We used this framework to interpret the life cycle of an aesthetic; how it emerges, spreads, and becomes established through these four categories.</p>
    <p></p><ul>
        <li><strong>Person:</strong> Individuals such as creators, influencers, and consumers who actively participate in shaping and redefining aesthetic trends.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> The methods and activities involved in the creation and dissemination of aesthetics. This encompasses the collaborative practices that facilitate the rapid evolution and reinterpretation of aesthetic concepts.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Product:</strong> The tangible and intangible outputs of aesthetic practices, such as visual elements, fashion, music that embody the principles of a particular aesthetic.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Press:</strong> The media and other environmental factors that influence the development and reception of aesthetics. This includes cultural, social, and technological contexts that shape how aesthetics are perceived and valued.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, building on Aldo Gangemi’s integrated ontology of creativity theories ("CreOn"), we also adopted the notions of personal creativity phases and meta-convergence frames to conceptualize how aesthetics evolve as creative processes. </p>
    <p>In this perspective, the diffusion of an aesthetic can be understood through three creative phases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divervence:</strong> The initial stage in which an aesthetic is born and expands. It involves inspiration, serendipitous encounters, and the creative recombination of existing elements, products, and media. On fast-moving social platforms, divergent activity manifests through abundant, experimental content creation.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Convergence:</strong> The subsequent phase where an aesthetic starts to solidify its identity and gain wider recognition. This includes the establishment of communities, the selection and refinement of characteristic elements, and platform-specific adaptations that stabilize the style</li><br>
        <li><strong>Metaconvergence:</strong> The elaboration phase that refines aesthetic expressions into culturally recognizable and contextually meaningful creative products. It introduces a reflective or evaluative layer, where an aesthetic is reinterpreted, reconstructed, or reproduced within its cultural environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By framing these stages within within aesthetics, our ntology conceptualizes the emergence and transoformation of aesthetics as a creative process.</p>
