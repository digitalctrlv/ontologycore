    <h3 id="ontology-intro">4.1 The Ontology</h3>
    <p class="lead">Our ontology formalizes aesthetics as complex cultural entities that emerge through community-driven
        creative processes on digital platforms. By modeling their characteristic elements and behavioral patterns, we
        can better understand how contemporary aesthetics differ from traditional subcultures in their formation and
        dissemination, and how they offer new popular ways of being creative through the reuse and recontextualization
        of past creative products.</p>
    <p>Aesthetics are abstract, dynamic, and modern concepts. With our ontology, we aim to map their characteristic
        elements, relevant behaviors, and the creative processes involved in their creation and dissemination. The
        previous chapters introduced three theoretical frameworks that helped us create these focus points and position
        these intangible cultural commodities within creative theory.</p>

    <p>There have been numerous resources classifying what belongs to an aesthetic and what does not. For example, we
        made deliberate use of the independent, crowd-sourced <a href="http://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/"
            target="_blank">Aesthetics Wiki</a> for identifying defining features of our selected aesthetics.
        Essentially, this classification task represents the genesis of aesthetics themselves. Aesthetics inherit from
        their 'parent class' of Subcultures the practice of inclusion and exclusion. This practice operates through
        various cultural forms such as art, music, and clothing, often based on ethnicity, interests, and social
        background.</p>

    <p>Undeniably, these types of social groupings are extremely similar. Yet recent aesthetics such as Clean Girl, Y2K,
        and Dark Academia demonstrate distinctive characteristics through <i>Metaconvergence</i>. This term is coined in
        the earlier mentioned <a href="https://github.com/aldogangemi/CreOn/blob/main/creon.ttl" target="_blank">CreOn
            ontology</a> and has become an increasingly popular method of expressing creativity on digital platforms. To
        clarify this concept within our framework, we interpret the term in our ontology core as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>"Metaconvergence is the process by which individuals or groups combine elements from multiple subcultures
                or aesthetics to create new, hybrid forms of expression. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in
                digital spaces, where the rapid exchange of ideas and cultural artifacts facilitates the blending of
                diverse influences. Metaconvergence allows for greater creativity and innovation, as individuals draw
                upon a wider range of sources to inform their aesthetic choices. It also reflects the fluid and dynamic
                nature of contemporary culture, where traditional boundaries between subcultures are increasingly
                blurred."</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Bricolage</i>, a creative technique within our Metaconvergence class, appears similar to the Montage and
        Collage art techniques that gained significant popularity during the Dada art movement in the first half of the
        twentieth century. Reusing existing visual elements is not an uncommon phenomenon in art and creativity.
        However, contemporary aesthetics like Y2K operate differently. Y2K's reproduction of a 2000s 'aesthetic' evokes
        particular emotions such as nostalgia or a sense of belonging to a period that users may have never even
        experienced. Creative products from the past are recontextualized at rapid speed, not just by one dominant
        artist but by an anonymous web community. Often, the motive is not protest against dominant culture but rather a
        means to gain acknowledgment for stylistic efforts and to shape identity.</p>

    <p>From here, with our ontology, we aim not only bring aesthetics into existence but also formalize the specific
        creative processes present in their emergence. It is valuable to move beyond understanding aesthetics as
        predominantly formalistic subcultures. Instead, we can observe how they facilitate a modern, grassroots,
        community-driven approach to identity formation and art making.</p>

    <p>We initially selected six aesthetics and adapted our model to their characteristics: <b>Y2K</b>,
        <b>Cottagecore</b>, <b>Dark Academia</b>, <b>Grunge</b>, <b>Old Money</b> and <b>Clean Girl</b>. Our selection
        aimed to cover a variety of aesthetics that address different temporal contexts and demonstrate distinct
        creative phases. Notwithstanding, we recognize that there is considerable overlap since their usage and
        emergence occur around the same time period. Therefore, our analysis will show that most of them use the same
        types of media channels to disseminate the aesthetic. This shared infrastructure highlights the interconnected
        nature of contemporary aesthetic movements and their collective reliance on digital platforms for expression and
        growth.

    <h3 id="modeling">4.2 Modeling</h3>
    <p class="lead">In this section we will describe how we used LLMs to model our ontology using a bottom-up extreme
        design methodolgy and CLOWN. During this phase, we systematically generated definitions, descriptions, and user
        scenarios for each aesthetic. This generated content informed the development of competency questions, which
        provided the structural foundation for constructing the ontology.</p>

    <h4 id="user-story">4.2.1 User story & LLMs</h4>
    <p class="lead">First stop: <b>C</b>ontext and Literature State of the Art (<b>C</b>LOWN).</p>

    <p>Our search for a model started by searching for interesting concepts that should be defined in the model. Here
        are some examples of the prompts we fed to the LLM and the output it provided us.</p>

    <p class="prompt">💁‍♀️Please give a definition of an "aesthetic."</p>
    <div class="chatbot">🤖 An "aesthetic" refers to a set of principles or philosophy concerning beauty, art, and
        taste. It encompasses the study of what makes something beautiful, pleasing, or artistically valuable. The term
        can be used in several ways:

        <li><b>As a noun: An aesthetic is a particular style, approach, or set of principles that defines what is
                considered beautiful or artistically appealing within a specific context. For example, "the minimalist
                aesthetic" emphasizes simplicity and clean lines, while "the vintage aesthetic" draws on nostalgic
                elements from past eras.</b></li>

        <li>In philosophy: Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that examines the nature of beauty, art, and artistic
            judgment. It explores questions like what makes something beautiful, how we experience and evaluate art, and
            what constitutes good taste.</li>

        <li><b>In everyday usage: People often use "aesthetic" to describe the overall visual style or mood of something
                - whether it's fashion, interior design, social media posts, or any curated visual presentation. In this
                context, it's become somewhat synonymous with "style" or "vibe."</b></li>
    </div>

    <p class="prompt">💁‍♀️Please give me 10 examples of aesthetics.</p>
    <div class="chatbot">🤖 Here are 10 examples of aesthetics:

        phenomena further.
    </p>

    <p class="prompt">💁‍♀️Please give me a description and user scenario for our selection of aesthetics.</p>
    <div class="chatbot">🤖 An "aesthetic" refers to a set of principles or philosophy concerning beauty, art, and
        taste. It encompasses the study of what makes something beautiful, pleasing, or artistically valuable. The term
        can be used in several ways:

        <ol>1. Y2K (/Cyber Y2K)</ol>
        Metallic silver textures, holographic materials, frosted plastics, bright blues and pinks, bubble shapes,
        futuristic fonts, digital camera aesthetics, low-resolution graphics, and late 90s/early 2000s technology
        references. Think iMacs, flip phones, and optimistic digital future vibes.<br>

        <i>User scenario:</i> Fashion Influencer's Aesthetic Evolution Jamie, a fashion content creator, embraces Y2K
        revival as both personal style and career strategy. They wear metallic fabrics, platform shoes, colorful hair
        clips, and carry iridescent handbags. They document their thrift shopping for vintage tech accessories, create
        makeup tutorials using holographic eyeshadows, and attend events in futuristic outfits. Their apartment features
        inflatable furniture and mood lighting that changes colors. This lifestyle positions them at the forefront of
        nostalgic fashion trends, appeals to their Gen Z audience's desire for optimistic futurism, and creates endless
        content opportunities around Y2K nostalgia.<br>

        <ol>2. Dark Academia</ol>
        Characterized by gothic architecture, vintage books, candlelit libraries, tweed blazers, leather-bound journals,
        classical art, and muted colors like deep browns, forest greens, and burgundy. Think old university halls,
        typewriters, and scholarly pursuits with a moody, intellectual atmosphere.<br>

        <i>User scenario:</i> Graduate Student's Daily Routine Sarah, a philosophy PhD candidate, structures her entire
        lifestyle around Dark Academia principles. She wakes early to write in leather-bound journals by candlelight,
        wears vintage blazers and wool sweaters to campus, carries her books in a worn leather satchel, and spends
        evenings in dimly lit libraries or coffee shops reading classical literature. She handwrites letters to friends,
        collects vintage fountain pens, and decorates her studio apartment with antique maps and poetry books. This
        lifestyle helps her feel connected to intellectual traditions, provides motivation for her rigorous studies, and
        creates a romantic narrative around academic pursuits that might otherwise feel isolating.<br>

        <ol>3. Cottagecore</ol>
        Emphasizes rural, pastoral life with floral patterns, vintage dresses, wildflower bouquets, homemade bread, cozy
        cabins, garden vegetables, and soft, natural lighting. Colors include cream, sage green, dusty pink, and earth
        tones that evoke a romanticized countryside lifestyle.<br>

        <i>User scenario:</i>Remote Worker's Life Shift Marcus, burned out from corporate life, adopts cottagecore
        living while working remotely as a freelance graphic designer. He moves to a small town, starts each day by
        tending his vegetable garden, bakes his own bread, and takes work breaks to forage for mushrooms or press
        flowers. He wears linen shirts, shops at farmers markets, preserves seasonal fruits, and hosts dinner parties
        featuring homegrown ingredients. This lifestyle provides stress relief, reconnects him with natural cycles, and
        gives him a sense of self-sufficiency that balances his digital work life.<br>

        <ol>4. Clean girl</ol>
        Lifestyle aesthetic, including heavy consumerism.
        is a recent fashion and lifestyle microtrend characterized by a minimalist and refined approach to beauty and
        style. It originated as a popular trend on TikTok and Instagram around 2023. This aesthetic draws inspiration
        from Scandinavian Design, minimalism, and the concept of "clean living." The "Clean Girl" trend has been adopted
        and popularized by influencers and celebrities like Hailey Bieber and Sofia Richie, who frequently show
        minimalist outfits and polished, "effortless" appearances. It largely overlaps with That Girl and Vanilla
        Girl.<br>

        <i>User scenario:</i> Emma, a 22-year-old marketing professional, adopts the Clean Girl aesthetic to cultivate a
        polished, effortless image for her new city life. She browses TikTok and Instagram for inspiration, purchasing
        minimalist staples like gold hoops and neutral loungewear. Emma films her simplified morning routine showcasing
        dewy skin and slicked-back hair, sharing it with trending audio. Through consistent posting, she gains social
        validation and refines her personal brand.

        <ol>5. Old Money</ol>
        Emulates understated elegance of generational wealth through tailored blazers, cable-knit sweaters, polo shirts,
        penny loafers, silk scarves, and pearl jewelry in neutral palettes. Emphasizes "quiet luxury" with timeless
        pieces and minimal logos. Associated with tennis, golf, yachting, and horseback riding. Often functions as
        performative facade—curating an image of inherited wealth through thrifted designer pieces and "elevated"
        hobbies regardless of actual economic status.<br>

        <i>User Scenario:</i> Sofia, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator, curates an "old money" persona on social
        media. She thrifts vintage Ralph Lauren, learns tennis at public courts, and photographs herself at free museum
        days. For Sofia, this aesthetic signals refinement and social capital through styling alone, offering comfort of
        appearing "established" while teaching her about quality and timeless taste.

        <ol>6. Grunge</ol>
        Grunge is an aesthetic rooted in the early 1990s alternative music scene, particularly from Seattle. It rejects
        mainstream polish and consumerism, embracing imperfection, rebellion, and authenticity. The style features
        flannel shirts, ripped jeans, band tees, combat boots, and layered thrifted clothing in muted or dark tones. Its
        visual language is raw and unkempt, expressing disillusionment with societal expectations and material excess
        while celebrating individuality and emotional honesty.

        <i>User Scenario:</i>
        Eli, a 20-year-old art student, expresses his grunge aesthetic through worn-out denim, oversized plaid shirts,
        and secondhand band tees. He frequents local record stores, sketches in cafés, and documents the city’s
        forgotten corners on film. For Eli, grunge isn’t just a fashion choice—it’s a way to resist conformity and find
        beauty in imperfection, using art and style as an outlet for frustration and self-discovery.

    <h4 id="classes-properties">4.2.2 Classes and properties</h4>
    <p class="lead"> During the development of our ontology, we repeatedly refined classes and properties to create an
        organic
        structure while maximizing the ontology's informativeness. We began by identifying all possible properties that
        could connect aesthetics with their elements, resources,
        influencers, and other related concepts. In the initial "draft" phase, we created over 100 properties. Step by
        step, we systematically refined them, removing or replacing properties with the most relevant ones. For
        instance, properties like <code>hasVisualElement</code>/<code>hasAudioElement</code> and similar were replaced
        with the more concise <code>characterizedBy</code>. Below you can explore the complete list of classes,

                <strong>Finding:</strong> Based on the results, many niche aesthetics drew inspiration from other,
                larger internet aesthetics. Conversely, the major aesthetic movements themselves frequently found their
                creative sources in historical imagery and past eras (Dark Academia, Steampunk), with several movements
                explicitly attempting to "revive" and reinterpret historical elements (Y2K, Old Money).
