    <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
    <p>In constructing the ontology, we referred to the principles from <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-516/pap21.pdf" target="_blank">eXtreme Design</a>, attempting to apply them to the modeling of aesthetics as cultural and creative phenomena. The process combined theoretical grounding with practical implementation, supported by collaborative design and iterative refinement among team members.</p>
    <p>The workflow and tools used in this project were as follows:</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><h4></h4><strong>Study of the Domain:</strong> We conducted an initial exploration of the field of aesthetics and creativity, identifying key aesthetic types, their cultural positioning, and representative case studies. This phase established the conceptual foundation of the ontology.</li><br>
            <li><strong>User Scenario Development:</strong> With the assistance of large language models (LLMs), we created user scenarios representing individuals who embody or engage with particular aesthetics. These narratives served as a base for the formation of Competency Questions (CQs) to guide the design.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Definition of Basic Classes and Properties:</strong> We established the core structure by defining essential classes and properties by conceptually understanding the relationships that form an Aesthetic.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Model Refinement in Protégé:</strong> We utilized Protégé and WebProtégé to we refine class hierarchies, formalized relationships. This phase also included defining classes that align with CreOn to ensure semantic interoperability.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Instance Creation and Dataset Expansion:</strong> We populated the ontology with individual instances representing real-world aesthetics (e.g., Y2K, Old Money, Grunge), and further constructing a richer dataset for knowledge extraction and visualization.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Knowledge Extraction and Visualization:</strong>We tested the ontology through SPARQL queries based on the competency questions and visualized the resulting knowledge graphs to analyze connections between aesthetics, creativity phases, and emotional contexts.</li>
        </ol>
